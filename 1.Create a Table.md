# Stage 1/4: Create a Table
## Description
We need to store a lot of information in the library database: return dates, members' names, books available, and much more.  
For this purpose, we should create tables and match their columns with the correct data types.  
Let's get started!

## Objectives
  - Take a look at the database outline below.

## Explanation of the database

![Explanation of the database](./IMG1.png)

The ` **book** ` table  contains information about all the books in the library:  
- `id`: integer Primary key,
- `isbn`: a unique 13-digit identifier for books and book-like products as TEXT,
- `book_name`: title as TEXT,  
- `author`: author's name as TEXT,  
- `genre`: genre as TEXT,  
- `book_page`: number of pages as INTEGER 
- `book_year`: year of publication as INTEGER,  
- `rank`: rating as REAL,  
- `available`: how many books are available

The ` **student** ` table includes information about readers:
- `id`: integer, Primary key
- `full_name`: students name as TEXT
- `gender`: students gender as TEXT
- `date_of_birth`: students birthdate as TEXT

The ` **staff** ` table includes information about the employees who issue books:
- `id`: integer, Primary key
- `full_name`: employee name as TEXT
- `gender`: employee gender as TEXT
- `date_of_birth`: employee birthdate as TEXT

The ` **operation** ` table includes information about transactions that have occurred:
- `id`: integer Primary key
- `staff_id`: INTEGER Foreign key from `staff` table, 
- `student_id`: INTEGER Foreign key from `student` table,
- `book_id`: INTEGER Foreign key from `book` table,
- `iss_date`: the date of issue as TEXT,  
- `return_date`: the planned return date as TEXT,  
- `return_indicator`: state of issued book as NUMERIC: `issued — 0`, `returned — 1`

Your task is to create tables, set the data types for the columns, and apply the SQL constraints.

Pay attention to the following:
- Don’t forget to highlight the primary key and foreign key features. On the scheme, they are marked in bold and  
  connected with lines.
- Restrict the columns to NOT NULL.
- You do not have to worry about generating unique identifiers for rows within a table if its primary key column  
  is declared as INTEGER PRIMARY KEY.

### 😎 Use the SQLite syntax for creating tables.  
The following links could help you find more information on data types and foreign key in SQLite:  
- [Datatypes in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html),  
- [Foreign Key Support](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html).  

## Example
🤔 Assign your queries to the variables, as in the example. It is required for testing only.  

### Example 1: an extract from the program
```markdown
create_book_table = "CREATE TABLE book (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   ...
   ...
);"

create_student_table = "CREATE TABLE student (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   ...
   ...
);"
```
