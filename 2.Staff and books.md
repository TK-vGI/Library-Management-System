# Stage 2/4: Staff and books
## Description
You have created the necessary tables, but these tables should not remain empty. The library never stops working —  
readers take and return books every day. Large libraries need long shelves and databases for dealing with massive  
pools of data. It's time to fill our tables!

## Objectives
Add the following data requested from you to the required tables:
- The `book` table:

| book_name                                 | isbn       | genre         | author       | book_year | book_count | book_page | rank |
|-------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------|
| The Metamorphosis                         | 0393347095 | Novella       | Franz Kafka  | 2014      | 2          | 128       | 4.4  |
| Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix | 0439358078 | Fantasy       | J.K. Rowling | 2004      | 3          | 896       | 4.2  |
| Anna Karenina                             | 0198800533 | Realist Novel | Leo Tolstoy  | 2017      | 1          | 896       | 4.6  |

- The `staff` table:

| full_name     | gender | date_of_birth |
|---------------|--------|---------------|
| Steve Smith   | Male   | 1992-04-23    |
| Ashley Miller | Female | 1995-01-16    |

- The `student` table:

| full_name      | gender | date_of_birth |
|----------------|--------|---------------|
| Mia Yang       | Female | 1996-09-15    |
| Bob Lee        | Male   | 1997-12-13    |
| Eric Rampy     | Male   | 1995-08-21    |
| Stefany Ferenz | Female | 1996-04-01    |

- The `operation` table:

| student_id | staff_id | book_id | iss_date   | return_date   | return_indicator |
|------------|----------|---------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| 3          | 1        | 1       | 4 days ago | 10 days later | False            |
| 1          | 1        | 3       | Yesterday  | 13 days later | False            |
| 2          | 2        | 2       | Yesterday  | 6 days later  | False            |
| 4          | 2        | 2       | Yesterday  | 14 days later | False            |


## Pay attention to the following:
- Calculate the `iss_date` and `return_date` values.
- You may either write a date as a string in the following format `YYYY-MM-DD` or use the `date()` function to calculate a date.  
  For example, `date('now')` will return the current date. Check out this [link](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html) for more details.
- For `return_indicator` with delivery information: `0 = False`, `1 = True`.

## Example
🤔 Do not delete the code you've composed in the previous stage. Assign your queries to the variables, as in the example.  
It is required for testing only.

### Example 1: an extract from the program
```markdown
insert_book_table = "INSERT INTO book VALUES (...);"

insert_staff_table = "INSERT INTO staff VALUES (...);"
```
