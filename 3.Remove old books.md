# Stage 3/4: Remove old books
## Description
Sometimes, there's a need to change the number of books or return dates. A member can take more than one book;  
damaged books should be discarded.  
For these changes, update the database regularly.

## Objectives
Let's see what our data looks like now:
- The `**book**` table:

| id | book_name                                 | isbn       | genre         | author       | book_year | book_count | book_page | rank |
|----|-------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------|
| 1  | The Metamorphosis                         | 0393347095 | Novella       | Franz Kafka  | 2014      | 2          | 128       | 4.4  |
| 2  | Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix | 0439358078 | Fantasy       | J.K. Rowling | 2004      | 3          | 896       | 4.2  |
| 3  | Anna Karenina                             | 0198800533 | Realist Novel | Leo Tolstoy  | 2017      | 1          | 896       | 4.6  |

- The `**staff**` table:

| id | full_name     | gender | date_of_birth |
|----|---------------|--------|---------------|
| 1  | Steve Smith   | Male   | 1992-04-23    |
| 2  | Ashley Miller | Female | 1995-01-16    |

- The `**student** `table:

| id | full_name      | gender | date_of_birth |
|----|----------------|--------|---------------|
| 1  | Mia Yang       | Female | 1996-09-15    |
| 2  | Bob Lee        | Male   | 1997-12-13    |
| 3  | Eric Rampy     | Male   | 1995-08-21    |
| 4  | Stefany Ferenz | Female | 1996-04-01    |

- Then `**operation**` table:

| id | student_id | staff_id | book_id | iss_date   | return_date   | return_indicator |
|----|------------|----------|---------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1  | 3          | 1        | 1       | 4 days ago | 10 days later | False            |
| 2  | 1          | 1        | 3       | Yesterday  | 13 days later | False            |
| 3  | 2          | 2        | 2       | Yesterday  | 6 days later  | False            |
| 4  | 4          | 2        | 2       | Yesterday  | 14 days later | False            |

## In this stage, update the following:
- Replace the following information with what exists in the table: `Ashley Miller` -> `Ashley Bailey`;
- `Eric Rampy` returned the book ten days before the return date. Make the necessary changes to the operation table:  
  change the return date and the returned column to `true` for transaction;
- Add one more book to the available _"The Metamorphosis"_ accordingly.

## Example
🤔  Do not delete the code you've composed in the previous stage. Assign your queries to the variables, as in the example.  
It is required for testing only.

### Example 1: an extract from the program
```markdown
update_staff_inf = "UPDATE staff SET ... ;"

update_operation_inf = "UPDATE operation SET ...;"

update_book_inf = "UPDATE book SET ... ;"
```
